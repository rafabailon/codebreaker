            <p>Codebreaker is a logic game in which you, as a code-breaker, try to break a secret code generated by the
                game.</p>
            <p>The secret code is composed of four numbers that range between 1 and 6.</p>
            <p>You get 10 chances to break the code. In each turn, you make a guess of four numbers (again, 1 to 6). And
                the
                game will mark the guess with up to four + and - signs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in
                    the
                    secret code and in the same position.
                </li>
                <li>A - indicates a partial match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in
                    the
                    secret code but in a different position.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, given a secret code <strong>1234</strong>, a guess with <strong>4256</strong> would earn a
                <strong>+-</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The + is for the 2 in the second position in the guess, which matches the 2 in the secret code in
                    both
                    number and position: an exact match.
                </li>
                <li>The - is for the 4 in the first position in the guess, which matches the 4 in the code but not in
                    the same
                    position: a partial match.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The plus signs for the exact matches always come before the minus signs for the number matches and donâ€™t
                align
                with specific positions in the guess or the secret code.</p>
