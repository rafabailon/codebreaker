    <h1>Codebreaker</h1>
    <p>Codebreaker is a logic game in which you, as a code-breaker, try to break a secret code generated by the
        game.</p>
    <p>The secret code is composed of four numbers that range between 1 and 6.</p>
    <p>You get 10 chances to break the code. In each turn, you make a guess of four numbers (again, 1 to 6). And the
        game will mark the guess with up to four + and - signs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the
            secret code and in the same position.
        </li>
        <li>A - indicates a partial match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the
            secret code but in a different position.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, given a secret code <strong>1234</strong>, a guess with <strong>4256</strong> would earn a <strong>+-</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The + is for the 2 in the second position in the guess, which matches the 2 in the secret code in both
            number and position: an exact match.
        </li>
        <li>The - is for the 4 in the first position in the guess, which matches the 4 in the code but not in the same
            position: a partial match.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The plus signs for the exact matches always come before the minus signs for the number matches and donâ€™t align
        with specific positions in the guess or the secret code.</p>
